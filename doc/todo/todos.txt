TRIANA TODO LIST
================

This is an (internal) place to put bug reports/fixes and feature requests.
If you have something more substantial than a note/paragraph, e.g. a diff/fix,
then number it (e.g. "1"), add the number in this file, and check in a separate file ("1.txt") into the parent directory of this file
with the diff/fix in it.

One day, we'll set up JIRA :-)



BUGS
====

Found while playing around with the GUI. If you create a group of tools, with a set number of inputs and outputs, and wire them all up in the "root" window, and then add some more input or output connectors to the sub-group, this change isn't updated in the root window. 

update: I found the "Resolve Group Nodes" option in one of the right-click menus, which sorts it all out.



take Tool resolver out of thread and put in GUI code.
