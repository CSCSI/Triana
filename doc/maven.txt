MAVEN INTELLIJ integration
==========================

Here's some instructions on integrating Intellij with maven.
They are not complete and it might be that I do some things in a round about way, but it works for me.

1. When you download a maven project from svn, run mvn idea:idea in the root directory containing the pom.xml file.
This will create an intellij project for you.
2. open the project in Intellij.
3. On the right of the screen you should see a sideways maven tab. Click on it.
4. Click on the maven settings button with the spanner.
    This will allow you to tell intellij where maven is in the maven config window.
5. In the maven config window, edit maven home directory by clicking 'override' and inserting the path to
    your maven installation, i.e. mine is "/Applications/java/apache-maven-2.2.1"
6. In the maven config window edit the maven user settings by clicking "override" and
    inserting where your maven settings.xml file, i.e. mine is "/Applications/java/apache-maven-2.2.1/conf/settings.xml"

If you don't know where your settings.xml is, check in <maven-home>/conf/
If you don't know where your maven home is and can't find it, take up flower arranging.

NOTE: Annoyance factor - I seem to have to do this for every project -
I'm sure there is a better but I haven't got round to finding it.

7. Click ok.
8. In the maven sidebar, click the Plus (+) button and navigate to the pom.xml file
    from which you created the ipr file. Select this file and click ok. The sidebar should get populated
    with the modules of the project. From here you can execute the maven targets like install, clean etc.

9. The maven plugin tries to keep up to date with changes you make, e.g.
    if you edit a pom file in intellij, it will offer to reimport.
    This doesn't ways work in my experience. To force a reimport you can right click on a directory
    or project in the left tree in intellij and select maven -> force reimport.

NOTE: I also have an M2_HOME environment variable set pointing to my maven home. The maven plugin suggests that
it can read this and does not need you to set the maven home in the config dialog if you have this set,
but in my experience this is a bare-faced lie.
