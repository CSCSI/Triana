TRIANA TODO LIST
================

This is an (internal) place to put bug reports/fixes and feature requests.
If you have something more substantial than a note/paragraph, e.g. a diff/fix,
then number it (e.g. "1"), add the number in this file, and check in a separate file ("1.txt") into the parent directory of this file
with the diff/fix in it.

One day, we'll set up JIRA :-)
